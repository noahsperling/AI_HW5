Input Values for Neural Network:
    - food count AI
    - food count enemy
    - queen health
    - drone count
    - worker count
    - worker 1 carrying
    - worker 2 carrying
    - worker 1 distance
    - worker 2 distance
    - drone distance
    - drone distance
    - queen distance
    - queen on anthill/tunnel/food
    - queen distance from closest enemy

These are now currently incorrect

There are 12 inputs.  The second layer has 9 neurons ((12 + 1) * (2 / 3) rounds to 9). Finally, the last layer has one.

So, the input matrix is 12 x 1.  The second weight matrix is 9 x 12.  The third weight matrix is 1 x 9.  The resulting
1 x 1 matrix is then sent through the last neuron and gives the output.
